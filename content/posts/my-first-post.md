# What is Grdon

Grdon is an ancient Armenian word, meaning "the practice of accomplishing tasks in a way, that will not be the most ideal one, will reflect the carelessness and/or incompetence of the person who worked on the task and required near-minimal effort from the grdonshik.
Pretty bad you might think. I'll disagree. You see, there are lots of things in this world that constantly require our attention. How often we try to achieve near-perfect results in the tasks, that don't even matter, doing the job we don't even love. We try to dedicate our meticulous attention to the small things that don't matter in the big picture. We need to separate what is important for us, and what is not. And for the things that are not, just grdon them. Nothing more, nothing less, grdon is the only way to perfection.
